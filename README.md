# HOLIDAZE (PROJECT EXAM 2)

This was our last exam. The goal here was to take the skills we have learned over the last years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect my general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

In this assignment we should make a hotel booking website for a company called Holidaze from Bergen.

We should also deliver:
- A Gantt chart planning the project
- A style guide
- An Adobe XD prototype


- We should use a CSS Pre-processor and BEM if not using CSS Modules, Styled Components, Bootstrap etc ( I used Bootstrap)
- We could choose between using React.js or Next.js ( I used React.js )
- We should have a fully working website that fullfils the brief
- We could use regular JS or TypeScript



## Description

### Brief (Our task)

A local tourism agency in Bergen is launching a new website called ‘Holidaze’ for visitors to the area to be able to find hotels, B&Bs and guesthouses, and for the accommodation owners to receive enquiries.
The project requires you to create the visitor side of the website where users can search accommodation and make enquiries, as well as the administration side where properties can be added and enquiries managed.
You will need to create an API to store the data for the establishments, enquiries and contact submissions. You can choose to use WordPress or Strapi as a Headless CMS, but it is very important that the API is deployed and publicly available.

### Requirements for the Website

#### Visitor Side
- It should be a homepage
- It should be a search bar typeahead (auto dropdown with hotel names that match what has been typed)
- It should be a results page with all hotels
- It should be a hotel specific page which displays all details about the hotel
- It should be an enquiry page either modal or separate page
- It should be a contact page (different to enquiry page) which goes to the admin for Holidaze

#### Admin side
- Here we should create a login section that makes use of JWT tokens
- It should be a list of enquiries and new enquiries appear when user submits the form on the enquiry page
- It should be a list of messages from contact form
- The admin can create a new establishment
